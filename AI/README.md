# AI Module – DermAI

This folder documents the **Artificial Intelligence research and development work** conducted as part of the DermAI graduation project.  
The AI component focuses on **skin cancer classification (Benign vs. Malignant)** using deep learning techniques, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The work presented here represents the **research, experimentation, training, evaluation, and explainability** aspects of the AI pipeline.  
Model deployment and backend integration are handled as separate system components.

This repository contains dataset organization, exploration, and preprocessing procedures.

---

### Comparative Algorithms and Baseline Models
https://github.com/Raghad-Odwan/DermAI_Comparative_Algorithms  

Implementation and comparison of multiple deep learning architectures used as baseline and reference models.

---

### Image Validation Module
https://github.com/Raghad-Odwan/Image-Validation-Module-DermAI  

Development of an image validation module to ensure input image quality before training and evaluation.

---

### Training and Cross-Validation
https://github.com/Raghad-Odwan/DermAI_Training_Cross-validiation-  

Model training using cross-validation strategies to ensure robustness and generalization.

---

### Final Model Training
