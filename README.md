# DermAI – Skin Cancer Detection System

DermAI is a graduation project that aims to assist in the early detection of skin cancer by leveraging deep learning techniques.  
The system provides an end-to-end solution that integrates a web-based user interface, backend services, and an artificial intelligence module for skin lesion classification.

---

## Project Overview

DermAI is designed to classify skin lesions into **Benign** or **Malignant** categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
The system follows a modular architecture that separates responsibilities across frontend, backend, and AI components to ensure scalability and maintainability.

---

## System Architecture

The DermAI system consists of the following main components:

- **Frontend:** Web-based user interface for image upload and result visualization
- **Backend:** API services for request handling, authentication, and system coordination
- **AI Module:** Deep learning models for skin cancer classification and explainability
- **Documentation:** Project reports, specifications, and diagrams

Each component is developed and maintained in a dedicated repository and documented within this project.
